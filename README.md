This is a backup of full-bleed images for some of the cards of Legend of the Five Rings LCG, to be used on https://www.jigoku.online/

The art is replaced by a CSS code (I am using User CSS on Google Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb).


The images on User CSS can be changed on Jigoku website with the following code structure:

img[src='/img/cards/soshi-mika.jpg']
{
content: url(XXXXX);
}

PS: I do not own the copyrights of the original artwork (although I create the illustration for several of them myself, for the fan-based continuation project called Emerald Legacy, under the alias of Thulsa Doom), or for the card game itself. I just created these new card frames, for a different visualisation on the aforementioned website.
